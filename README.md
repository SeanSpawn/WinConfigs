# ‚öôÔ∏è \\\ WinConfigs
A simple batch script to manage Windows utilities, system info, repositories, and performance tweaks.

## üì¶ Installation 

### 1. Download the repository
- Clone this repository or download the ZIP. **If you downloaded the ZIP, make sure to extract it before running the script.**
```
git clone https://github.com/fr0st-iwnl/WinConfigs.git
```

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing Packages List (Scoop)
To configure the packages that will be installed by Scoop, you can modify the `packages-list.txt` file located in the `Configuration\scoop-packages\` directory. Simply open the file and add or remove package names as needed. Each line should contain one package name that you wish to install. Here‚Äôs an example of how the file might look:

```yml
git
nodejs
```

When you run the script, it will automatically read from this list and install the packages you‚Äôve added.

### Custom Repositories List
To configure the custom repositories that the script will manage, open the `repos-list.txt` file located in the `Configuration\custom-repos\` directory. Similar to the packages list, each line should contain the repository URL, the directory you want to install it into, and the description (separated by `#`). Here‚Äôs an example:

```yml
https://github.com/fr0st-iwnl/wallz#Wallz#Pictures#A collection of curated wallpapers.
https://github.com/fr0st-iwnl/WinMacros#WinMacros#Documents#Macros for productivity on Windows.
https://github.com/fr0st-iwnl/XPicker#XPicker#Documents#A slim and efficient color picker made in AutoHotkey.
```

Each repository will be listed with a prompt when you run the script, asking if you want to install it to your chosen directory. You can customize the repositories and directories as needed.
